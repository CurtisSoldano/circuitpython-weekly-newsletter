The AS7341 is done, at least for now; The CircuitPython library has been released and is available in the bundle and via pip, and the Arduino library should be added to the library manager soon. It has been an interesting sensor to work on, and I'm interested to see what people do with it.

One thing I've been pondering lately is the value of documentation. When a device is poorly documented or there are large pieces of documentation just missing, it's not unlike losing your keys: You know you what you're looking for, but you just can't find it. Good documentation on the other hand removes the friction that comes when just trying to find the thing you know you need to know. Stellar documentation  (see Texas Instruments and Analog Devices) goes a step further and calls your attention to information that you didn't know you needed.

Bad documentation is like a bad community: it's just not enjoyable to work with, and makes one turn to more pleasant alternatives.

This week, I worked on the implementation of PMWOut on the ESP32-S2, enabling PWM frequency and duty cycle modulation for LEDs and servo motors. It's been a breath of fresh air working with the ESP32, after coming from STM32 and NXP. Both of the latter companies have powerful chips, the also have very technical and sometimes convoluted documentation - Espressif clearly puts a lot of care into their API docs and examples to make them readable, and it shows. It's always nice to see hardware producers take extra steps to make high quality documentation and raise the standard for the rest of the industry.

I also worked on reviews for the STM32 F1 implementation, and the upcoming STM32 SDIO module, alongside preliminary work for the rest of ESP32-S2 PulseIO. The ESP's interface has been inspiring me to think of ways to use it in my own projects - though it's regrettable that the Bluetooth was cut to make room for native USB. I'm impatient for the day that we finally get our 500MHz Wifi/Bluetooth FS USB chip for under a dollar... but my fantasies for [capable computing](https://medium.com/@aallan/capable-computing-50867847a8d8) will have to wait.

This past week, I started out by looking at the Arduino ImageReader library because a user had pointed out that they were not able to get the example working on an M0 processor. It appears the result was due to an incomplete implementation on my part. So I dove in and started working on converting a similar class written for TFT displays to work on the eInk displays. As I went along, there were various states of success as it got closer to completion. Eventually, I got it drawing correctly and it's now integrated into the Arduino library.

After I finished the eInk displays, I moved over to writing a library that makes use of the RGB Matrix and Metro M4 Airlift Lite to provide a library to make using the Matrix with the internet as easy as the PyPortal library makes using the PyPortal. I decided to part from the way that PyPortal works and provide more of a library of functions which initializes the function rather a monolithic library that does one thing very well. I have decided to call the library MatrixPortal and am continuing to add functionality. Be sure to keep an eye out for it.

**Scott**

Last week I had a variety of tweaks to CircuitPython out for PR including switching to PyStack, adding `memorymonitor`, removing the existing network APIs and adding `.find` to `bytearray`. They've been merged and we're due for another release.

Yesterday, I continued work on the ESP32SPI and Requests libraries to optimize them for memory use. I was testing an unreleased PyPortal project to see if it can work. Memory use does look better but is still a challenge.

The end of this week I'm switching gears a little bit to add networking support to the ESP32S2 and also verifying some hardware design assumptions.
