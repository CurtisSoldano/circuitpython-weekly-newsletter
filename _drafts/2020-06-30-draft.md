**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## Whatâ€™s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in!

**Bryan**

This past week saw me updating the guide for the quite popular LSM9DS1 9-DoF IMU from ST. We've had a breakout for this capable little suite of sensors for a while and it has proven to be a favorite. Whenever you can get 9 degrees of freedom in a single package at an affordable price will be popular and the LSM9DS1 is quite popular.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200630/bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

With the LSM9DS1 as popular as it is, we decided it was due an update to join the Stemma QT family by shrinking it down a bit, moving a few things around, slapping on a few [SparkFun Quiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic ) compatible [Stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt) connectors, and giving it a fresh coat of Adafruit Black. The first version in Classic Blue is quite nice but I must admit the new one has caught my eye.

If you're a fan of the existing form factor, fear not! We're going to keep making the original version alongside the new Stemma QT version.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200630/bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

More recently I've been working on a CircuitPython library for the PCF8591 ADC+DAC combo sensor from NXP. This is a fairly simple but useful little package. It's 8-bit which doesn't quite measure up to the some of the more high-end ADCs and DACs out there but it comes with a DAC as well and it's relatively inexpensive as well as widely available. Having an ADC and DAC in a small package certainly has a lot of potential uses and the QT form factor will make it easy to squeeze into whatever use you find for it.

**Dan**

My main project now is implementing \_bleio yet again (third time!). This time I'm targeting the HCI Bluetooth implementation on ESP32 (not ESP32S2), which is used on our AirLift boards. HCI is a standard serial-based command protocol thatâ€™s used for many Bluetooth-capable co-processors.

I fixed a hang in `microcontroller.cpu.voltage` on SAMD51. The problem occurred on some samples of SAMD51 but not others, with identical chip versions. Having two pieces of supposedly identical hardware act differently can make testing difficult.

I'm experimenting with adding a flag to request that on brownout CircuitPython simply restart instead of going into safe mode. This is useful for solar-powered devices not hang up when their batteries start to get too low. 
 
We originally added safe mode to allow recovery when a board starts up and immediately draws so much power that the power supply voltage sags very low or shuts off. In that case you want to be able to fix the offending program. So these are two different use cases that both need to be accommodated.

**Jeff**

After failing to make progress on SDIO support with my crude setup, I ordered a development kit from Microchip with a properly wired SD card slot and an existing demo of its use that I could build from source.

This board, called SAM E54 Xplained Pro, is based on the SAM E54 microcontroller, which is very similar to the SAM D51 that is in so many of Adafruit's boards, but was not yet supported. There is now support for this board in CircuitPython and this paves the way for other boards based on SAM E54, and I have also successfully used this board to read SD cards using SDIO from within CircuitPython, so work on that pull request has resumed.

**Kattni**

This week has been keeping up with miscellaneous. I assisted with the Spanish translation of the CircuitPython Essentials guide. I started the update of the guide [ST 9-DoF Combo Board](https://learn.adafruit.com/st-9-dof-combo) with another [FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4569) that was recently put into the shop. I also included a note about an issue with the silk on the 9-DoF FeatherWings (SCL and SDA are swapped on the silk, but the pins are fine!). I worked with Melissa to write up a guide for the [1.3" Color TFT Bonnet for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4506). I also tested a few PRs and took care of some GitHub issues.

The most involved task ended up being one that I figured would take a minute or two. A while back I wrote a Learn guide for a [Circuit Playground Bluefruit NeoPixel Animation and Color Remote Control](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-bluefruit-neopixel-animation-and-color-remote-control). It was brought to my attention that the code for the NeoPixel Animator was no longer working. The fix was obvious: the API had changed in the CircuitPython LED Animation library and so the imports in the NeoPixel Animator code needed to be updated to match. However, once I updated the imports, I noticed the code wasn't functioning as expected. It turns out some updates to the LED Animation library had introduced some bugs that we hadn't encountered until this very specific use case. And, that's how 2 minutes turns into 2 days. But! The bugs were addressed, the code now runs as expected, and the NeoPixel Animator code and guide have been updated to reflect the new import style. Thanks to Tim for helping test all the fixes!

**Lucian**

This past week I've been working on reviews and debugging on a variety of minor issues. My major project as of this week is reworking the timer system on the STM32 to be more flexible - currently, modules can only use a single timer or a subset of timers that have been allocated for them, but that leaves too few timers for new modules like RotaryIO. The new system will share various timers between modules, picking those that are least commonly used externally for internal purposes like PulseIO timing and RGBMatrix management. 

**Melissa**

This past week I started out by finishing updating a 9-DoF sensor calibration guide where I describe how to use a script to calibrate the sensor easily on a Raspberry Pi. You can check out that [guide page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sensorlab-magnetometer-calibration/calibration-with-raspberry-pi-using-blinka.).

[![Melissa](../assets/20200630/melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I have also been working on porting the PyPortal library over to Blinka. This was a fun project because it builds on top of the displayio library that I had already been working on. Since linux already has built in facilities for things like networking, a lot of it involved stripping out things like communicating with the airlift ESP module. Since things like displays are added onto the Raspberry Pi and not built in, I needed to add functionality to be able to define the display, so it likely won't be quite as clean as opening examples written for the PyPortal without modification. At this point I have the BitCoin example running and will be working to make the library more seamless.

Finally, I have been working with Kattni to write a guide for the 1.3" PiTFT Bonnet with Joystick. The learn guide should be out very soon.

**Scott**

This week my focus has been wrapping up SPI on the ESP32-S2. I've gotten TX going with DMA and RX is likely working (will test it tomorrow.) Yay! I made two more changes following this. First, I enabled `displayio` so FourWire (SPI) displays can now be used.

Second, since I was using a Saleae to check the SPI transaction, I noticed that the display initialization was kinda slow. So, I removed a 10ms delay we used to allow the idle task to run and disabled its watchdog. I also changed the CPU speed from 160mhz to 240mhz so that is also speedier.

Next up, I need to make a PR with all of the busio changes. After that, we need to tune up our background tasks and then we can work to releasing 6.0.0. (5.4.0 will be renamed 6.0.0 because we're renaming I2CSlave to I2CPeripheral.)
