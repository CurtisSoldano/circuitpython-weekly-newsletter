## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/DIR-LOCATION/DATE-blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I finished up the DS1841 libraries for CircuitPython and Arduino including support for manually setting the wiper, editing and using the LUT, and enabling or disabling the temperature compensation feature. Now that we will have a log potentiometer, I hope to see more people using these handy little I2C helpers to give them programatic control over parts of their circuit.

Next up I'm starting the long process of migrating all of our Arduino library repositories on GitHub over to using GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Having a solid CI system is invaluable for making sure that tedious things like checking formatting and documentation are still up to snuff without relying on humans to remember to check regularly. For folks with _many_ repositories and _many_ contributors, a good CI system is basically required. 

GitHub Actions is particularly useful because it's well integrated with GitHub, which many folks use for hosting their projects. We have a _lot_ of repositories, so having a common framework for CI and project hosting is going to help keep things in check.

In the Bluetooth Low Energy device-of-the-week world, I'm now working on CircuitPython BLE drivers to connect to a couple of different low-cost pulse oximeters. I am reliably getting data from one, and am working on the other.

I had a breakthrough on the SAMD51 spurious flash writes problem with the help of community members, and am now testing a fix. It appears we just need to set the brownout voltage detection to higher than the factory preset value.

**Jeff**

With my big projects, there's not much to show this week. The RGB matrix code with Protomatter is slowly improving, but more work is needed to make it behave 100% like a SPI or I2C display, and to make sure we lay the best groundwork for future framebuffer-bsaed displays.

But the little things matter too! A pull request merged this week will improve the error message when assigning to properties that are read-only. Formerly, the error would state "'SPI' object has no property 'frequency'", but in a future release of CircuitPython it will say "'SPI' object cannot assign property 'frequency'", giving a better experience when troubleshooting your code.

**Kattni**

This week we've all had our lives turned a bit upside down. Remember you're not alone in this, and the Adafruit community is here to support you. Reach out to us on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord) for any reason. There are thousands of people in the same situation, all continuing to gather together to support each other through this. Remember to share your projects and ideas, and continue to help others navigate this uncertain situation. We are strongest together.

I worked on updating a couple of guides with new revisions of the boards: the [APDS9960 proximity, color, light and gesture sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-apds9960-breakout) and the [VL6180 time of flight sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-vl6180x-time-of-flight-micro-lidar-distance-sensor-breakout). We added STEMMA connectors to both boards, and I updated the guides with updated photos, wiring diagrams, schematics and pinouts. The guides now have everything needed to get started with your new STEMMA compatible breakouts.

We've also begun the process of applying to [certify](https://certification.oshwa.org/) some of our Adafruit hardware as Open Source with the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/). We're starting with our [CircuitPython compatible microcontroller boards](https://www.adafruit.com/category/956). Dylan has gathered the necessary info and started submitting the applications. We'll keep you posted on the progress. We're looking forward to being a part of the growing [list of OSHWA certified Open Source projects](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html)!

This past two weeks I've been working on transitioning the STM32 Port over to the H7 and F7. This has been a two parter - on the one hand I've been adding new functionality to support the Cortex M7 and new peripheral types featured on these chips, but on the other I've been revisiting and fixing old and inflexible code that wasn't built to handle chips outside of the STM32F4 series. One recent addition has been Python scripts to auto-generate peripheral code for the different variations of STM32 SoCs, as well as a revamp of how packages are managed in the Microcontroller module. 

While I have my first version compiled and running on the H743 Nucleo, I'm still testing to make sure that the new changes do not break F4 builds like the Feather or Discovery boards. I've also been keeping tabs on other STM32 work that's been done by others recently, such as the new NVM module for flash memory, and the low power work being done by Scott via the RTC module. 

Outside of Circuitpython, I've been in touch with some open-source colleagues who are working on projects that they hope will combat the spread of COVID19. I'm hoping I'll have more updates about that soon.

This week I finished up a Follow-up guide for adding new Single Board Computers to Blinka. Where as the first guide was about adding detection code so that Blinka knew which board it was working with, this guide was the real meat about actually adding your board to Blinka. You can check out the guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-blinka.

I also worked on re-skinning the Web Bluetooth Dashboard that I worked on a few weeks ago to make it match the Adafruit website much better. This was more than just changing some colors and adding a logo, but required working on developing some new panels so that it looked much better for the user.

**Scott**

Up to the start of this week I was continuing my work on sleep. I wrapped up STM32 and then iMX RT when surprisingly quickly. So, sleep is getting close and will need thorough testing. The PR will be out of draft once two dependent PRs are merged in.

While I wait for those PRs, I've swapped to BLE MIDI. I've got MIDI coming out of CircuitPython and am working on getting MIDI in going. It's been quick so far and should wrap up soon. There are a few fixes to CircuitPython core that will be needed for it. I'm excited to hack an nRF52840 into some of these old 80s era piano keyboards I have to give them midi in and out. :-)

Once BLE MIDI is done, I'll circle back to sleep and get that code checked in as well. Exciting times!
