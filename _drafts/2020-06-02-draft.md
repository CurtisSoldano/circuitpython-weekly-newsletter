## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This past week has seen me returning to working on the libraries for the ST ICM20948 9-DoF motion sensor. You may recall from previous updates that this chip integrates its magnetometer a bit differently. While it's common to see multiple sensors integrated into the same package, it is not all that common to see one of the included sensors accessed through one of its neighbors in the package.

Like some other chips, the ICM20948 includes an external I2C bus that can be used to integrate with and control additional sensors through the same libraries. This is likely done to allow flexibility with what sensors are used to augment the existing ones. In the case of the ICM20948, the gyro and accelerometer are bundled together in the same register space, however the integrated [AK09916 3-axis magnetometer/compass by AsahiKASEI](https://www.y-ic.es/datasheet/78/SMDSW.020-2OZ.pdf) is connected to the external I2C bus controlled by the ICM20948!

The result of this is that the normal configuration of the magnetometer has to be orchestrated by the I2C master controller in the ICM20948. The biggest struggle I've had while working on these libraries, and indeed any library was surrounding this orchestration. To make a long story short, in certain situations the I2C master controller in the ICM20948 would get into a bad state and not be able to communicate with the magnetometer.

As the song goes, "I get by [with a little help from my friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends)" and indeed our friends at SparkFun had already ran into and solved this issue in their [Arduino](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ICM-20948_ArduinoLibrary) and [Python](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_9DoF_IMU_ICM20948_Py) libraries. The solution was to check for a bad connection by trying to read from the sensor a number of times, then resetting the I2C master if it was unsuccessful. Indeed I had tried this, however the key was that they continued this cycle until the sensor responded or a given number of failed attempts.

**Big thanks to SparkFun engineers Pete Lewis, Nathan Seidle, Owen and others** for saving my bacon!

As a result of the newfound stability of the magnetometer, I was able to add in support for adjusting the data rate of the magnetometer, so I have some pretty graphs for you! First is the magnetometer measuring at 10Hz:

**Dan**

I'm re-implementing the CircuitPython [\_bleio](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/_bleio/index.html) API using [bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/). So far I've implemented scanning for advertisements. The bleak library uses Python's asyncio capabilities but \_bleio is a conventional "sync" interface. So I I spent time learning the details of using asyncio with threads, and used the [janus.queue](https://github.com/aio-libs/janus) library to pass data between the sync and async worlds as it arrives. It works on Linux and Windows, but I'm having issues with MacOS due to threads, and have submitted a bug report.

The next step is to extract as much information from the bleak scanning results as possible. The \_bleio scanning interface passes back more information than is available via bleak, so I have to figure out what is essential and simulate or avoid the rest.

**Jeff**

I've been working on support for SD cards using a potentially-faster interface called SDIO.  This is the way the SD card is connected on the STM32F405 Feather, and is not currently usable from CircuitPython, which only understands SD cards connected via SPI.  My early results show that when reading bulk data directly from the SD card (not using a FAT filesystem), some pretty impressive data rates.  Next up, I'll give the same treatment to the SAMD51 port of CircuitPython.

This week I continued working with LED animations and published the CircuitPython LED Animations guide. There's nothing like writing a guide for a library to find bugs in that library. So, along with the guide came a series of bug fixes and GitHub issues for bugs that weren't as urgent. As for the guide, apparently making 31 animated GIFs takes much longer than I expected, so it took a bit longer than I originally planned. But the guide turned out really well. If you're interested in displaying animations on your NeoPixels or DotStars, check out the [CircuitPython LED Animation library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LED_Animation) and the [associated guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-led-animations).

Next up is porting the Arduino AHTx0 library to CircuitPython for the AHT10 sensor. 

**Lucian**

This past week I've mostly been bug-hunting on the mimxrt10xx, adding in pin reset features and stress testing busio as much as possible. My time has been cut a little by the fact that my home office has been unbearably hot during the summer days, but I'll be returning to the core of Boston soon for a (hopefully) more regular schedule. 

In the coming week I'll be working pulseio for the i.MX port, and possibly revisiting STM32 for some older bugs and other issues I turned up while working on the i.MX's implementations. 

**Melissa**

This past week, I was pretty focussed on porting displayio over to Blinka. This was really a lot of fun and I probably spent more time working on it than I normally do on projects, but I also got a lot out of it.

One of the more interesting challenges was having the Raspberry Pi writing to the display without blocking the user's script. The way I got around that was to implement threading for the display and as depending on whether auto_refresh was on or off, it would automatically start or stop the thread.

I also implemented fontio as part of it so that we could have even more compatibility between the CircuitPython and Blinka platforms. The way that it works is that it uses Pillow to render its fallback font and then converts that into a displayio Bitmap for complete compatibility. I was able to get the font transparencies working as well.

One of the more pleasant surprises I had was during testing in that I had written it to be compatible enough, that it ran the example for the Display Shapes library perfectly and I wasn't even expecting it to run.

There's still a lot of items to tackle to make it complete, but you can find the library at [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio) if you would like to experiment with it or work on some of the issues.

**Scott**

The improvements to the ESP32S2 port for pin tracking and digitalio has been merged. I've started on busio and will stream more about that work this week. Thanks to Ivan for helping me get over some hurdles with that.
