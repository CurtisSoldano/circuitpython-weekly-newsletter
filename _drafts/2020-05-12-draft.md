## Adafruit Update

[![Adafruit Heart New York](../assets/20200512/heart.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

Adafruit Industries continues to run with 100% of employees being paid and continuing to work. Most are working remotely, with some working in the Manhattan, New York factory as an essential service and business under NYC Executive Order 202.6 Capabilities. Adafruit was deemed an essential service to distribute/make some PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) such as face shields, and manufacturer electronics for essential life-saving/preserving equipment and development which is needed in New York and beyond. -[Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

The CircuitPython team is going full steam ahead in development and rollout. We're expecting CircuitPython 5.1.0 to be stable and released soon and features for 5.2.x are being discussed. Would you like to join us? On Discord, head to https://adafru.it/discord to discuss things. And check out [Awesome CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython/blob/master/README.md) for a wide range of information.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

The name of the game this week is filters! I've been working on the Arduino library for what I'm now calling the "LIS331" family of high to extremely high g accelerometers. Vibrations are everywhere and since accelerometers are really good at measuring them, to be able to find the data or signal you're interested in from all those measurements it can be useful to be able to say "I definitely don't care about all of that". If you've got a needle in a haystack,  a good first step to find the needle is saying "well, I know the needle isn't in this half," and then proceeding to feed that half to the cows. 

This is where filters come in. Just like a coffee filter that keeps the big grounds of coffee out of your cup, a filter for a sensor like an accelerometer can separate one big pile of stuff into two or more piles of stuff based on some criteria. In the case of a coffee filter, the criteria is "is this piece of stuff small enough that I don't mind having it in my coffee cup?" When talking about measurements from sensors, there’s a lot of different criteria you could use to filter the data, but a common one and one that is built into the LIS331 and many other sensors is filtering based on the frequency of the signal or how fast the signal is changing. Frequency is commonly measured in Hertz or cycles per second.

Here is a graph of the output from the H3LIS331DL while I’m using a tool to create high frequency vibration that causes the acceleration felt by the sensor to change rapidly:

[![Bryan](../assets/20200512/20200512bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

In the area surrounded by the red box, you can see that the graph is pretty jagged and “peaky” because it’s displaying as much as it can of the different acceleration values regardless of frequency. Note the line marked “25” which I've added to this and the next plot as a reference point because the Arduino plotter automatically re-scales the graph.

Now check out this graph of the same vibrations with the built in low pass filter removing all of the signal changing faster than 37 times a second or 37 Hertz:

[![Bryan](../assets/20200512/20200512bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Compared to the previous plot, you can see that the graphs look much cleaner because the high peaks and valleys for each graph have been subdued. This is the 37Hz Low Pass Filter doing its job of only passing along data that is cycling slower than 37Hz.

These sensors also have support for a high pass filter which I’m also working on though I’ll have to come up with a better testing method to verify the output.

[![Dan](../assets/20200512/20200512dan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm finishing up the [Adafruit BLE Services library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_Adafruit). It provides BLE services that work with the [Bluefruit Playground app](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app). I have CircuitPython programs that communicate with the app, in the same way that the [Arduino UF2's we supply](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app/firmware) do.

The app is not the only way to use the Adafruit Services library. You'll be able to use the library as a BLE central as well, to get sensor data or control NeoPixels or DotStars.

The library required some changes to the PacketBuffer class core CircuitPython BLE support. I finally finished those changes earlier this week after some false starts.

Next up:
Getting CircuitPython download data automatically again, now that we've switched from GitHub artifacts to Amazon S3 storage for release downloads.
Implementing **\_bleio** using the **bleak** library on host computers.
Trying to communicate with a BLE-capable fever thermometer.

**Jeff**

As seen elsewhere in the newsletter, I helped with the setup of Weblate, to make it easier for the community to contribute translations of CircuitPython.  Please help us out by adding or improving translations.

I started a new project this week to create a version of adafruit_sdcard which is written in C instead of in Python.  We hope that this new version will have higher performance and leave more memory free for your Python code and objects.  Initial results for a single file on a single card show that reading a large file 4096 bytes at a time became about 40% faster.  However, additional testing on multiple SD cards and CircuitPython boards is indicated.

While working on the code, I was inserting and removing the SD card repeatedly.  I think mechanical stress was probably the reason this card broke in two, but software bugs are not entirely ruled out :wink:

**Kattni**

This week I finished up the CircuitPython library GitHub issue sweep. Between following up with original authors and putting in a few PRs of my own, I managed to close at least 50 issues. As well, I went back through and made sure to label every issue I could, and reply to those I could not. The list available on the [Contributing page on circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/contributing) is sortable by issue label, and now that information is far more useful as each issue is now labeled. If you're interested in contributing to CircuitPython, check it out, it's a great place to start. Good First Issues are available for those who are new or looking for something simple. Otherwise you can look into bug fixes, enhancement requests or documentation updates if you're interested in something a bit more involved. Check it out and feel free to ping us with any questions!

**Lucian**

This week I've been handling mostly bugfixes and reviews, along with some new additions. I added a basic port of the OpenMV, a camera development board hosting the powerful STM32 H743 SoC - a somewhat anemic addition, given that Circuitpython does not support cameras (yet!), but it's also the first third party H7 board supported by the port. Other additions this week included DisplayIO support on the H7 and F7 series, and some initial revisions to the i.MX port to support uni-directional SPI. This week I'll be following up the i.MX work to flesh out the QoL features in Microcontroller, including pin claiming, peripheral reservation, and the like.

On my personal time, I spent a somewhat regrettable amount of effort yesterday getting unicode Japanese support on an e-paper featherwing. My ambition is to eventually have a lightweight smart flashcards system (inspired by Anki) on Circuitpython to study math and languages without a backlight. It's sadly not very impressive yet - the display takes a whopping 40 seconds to update just a handful of glyphs - but asking around it seems there may be some accessible ways to speed it up. Hosting the font on an SD card rather than internal flash will also allow more fleshed out character support.

This past week I focused mostly on adding the I2C protocol to the Adafruit_CircuitPython_BitbangIO library. This was fairly difficult because it seemed any existing examples implementing this were written just slightly differently or largely incomplete. One of the sources that I found most helpful was looking at how CircuitPython had implemented it and using that as a base worked pretty well. I also checked the output when running hardware I2C with my logic analyzer and compared that to the output and I was able to get some good data when I tested with the BME280.

After that, I started working on adding support for the GreatFET one to Blinka. This was inspired by a tweet that I saw by Michael Ossmann where he mentioned that you could run a GreatFET One with Python and the fact that I had received one from Kate Tempkin at the Hackaday SuperCon this past year. I already have it being detected and it seems like it will be pretty straightforward to add.

**Scott**

This week I've been working on CircuitPython for the ESP32-S2. It's all hacked together but I've managed to get the REPL working. On [my stream last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emvVydYoGxw), I added pin definitions and talked about the linker errors I was hitting. This week, I fixed the linker errors and fixed a few issues at startup with FreeRTOS and TinyUSB. The REPL is now working!!!

The next steps are to get the flash working for the CIRCUITPY drive and then polish it up and merge it. Tune into my live streams, Fridays at 2pm Pacific, for the latest info.
