**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep an eye out here for updated download stats coming soon!

## Whatâ€™s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in!

**Bryan**

Short week for me, so I wrapped up the LIS3DH library refactor to allow for the use of the H3LIS331 and LIS331HH, siblings of the LIS3DH. This type of refactor will likely become more and more common as sensor manufacturers look to expand their offerings by spinning off new products based on existing ones.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200421/20200421bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Otherwise I started playing around with the [SSI2164 Quad Voltage Controller Amplifier made by Sound Semiconductor](http://www.soundsemiconductor.com/downloads/ssi2164datasheet.pdf). This chip is an update by Dave Rossum to his SSM2164 with a few improvements. I'm currently pairing it with an OPA4171 to bone up on my analog skills with an eye towards building filters and oscillators.

Work on RGB Matrix support in CircuitPython continues.  The initial Pull Request is accepted, but there's still work to do to make the API easier to use.  Here, I'm testing the wiring for the Feather nRF52840 Express.  While the guide will focus on the Feather M4 Expressâ€”because it has a compatible shield and doesn't require custom wiringâ€”we'll also include wiring guidance for Feather nRF52840 Express and Sense, ItsyBitsy M4, and ItsyBitsy nRF52840.

This past week, I was focused on getting the Onion Omega2+ working with Blinka. I had previously been attempting to get it working with OpenWRT. I switched over to using the OnionOS that comes on the board by default and I was able to get I2C and UART working in addition to the GPIO. SPI was still having some difficulty reading values even though the correct signals were appearing. I put that on hold for the moment, but expect to finish it up soon.

After that, I switched over to writing the SPI module for the external CircuitPython BitBangIO library. This is to manually flip the GPIO pins for boards that have neither the BitBangIO module or working hardware SPI. It actually worked well on the Raspberry Pi, but ran pretty slowly on the Jetson Nano. It would still work for communicating with sensors. The library is on [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BitbangIO). I will be adding an I2C module to the library soon as well.

**Scott**

[![Scott](../assets/20200421/2020421scott.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm getting closer and closer to wrapping up the lower power work. While I wait for review cycles I've started a couple other projects.

Last week I took my first glimpse at the ESP32-S2 by getting TinyUSB running on the Saola dev board. I streamed my adventures last Friday on the Adafruit channels and posted it - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zq8RHXVdSI). I'll likely be streaming this Friday as well at 2pm Pacific. My next step is to establish the port folder in CircuitPython and start connecting the CircuitPython build system to the ESP-IDF build system. I've been lots of help from UnexpectedMaker and Espressif folks so thanks to them!

I've been reviewing lots of awesome PRs and also attending the Python Language Summit which is online just like PyCon - [via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjMBMGt0WJQLeluw6qNJuA/videos).

Tuesday night Ladyada got me a dump of the USB traffic for a fever scanner. I've been hacking on the protocol to extract the image and the maximum temperature. The goal is to build an open source app to connect to the device rather than the proprietary Windows app that the manufacturer provides.
