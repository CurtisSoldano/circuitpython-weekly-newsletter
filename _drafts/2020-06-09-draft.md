## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

With the work on the ICM20948 library completed, I moved on to finishing up the previously started tester code. Testers are the final arbiter of if a board is fit to be sold, so the tester code is where we make sure that we've tested all of the hardware on the breakout board. We can fix libraries later if we've missed something or haven't enabled a feature, however once the hardware ships to customers, that's how it's going to be for as long as they own it. Testers and the code that powers them are responsible for catching any glitches in manufacturing that while rare do occur, so making sure the tester code is right is in some ways more important than the library itself.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200609/bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

After finishing work on the ICM20948, I shifted to adding support for the LSP22 pressure sensor to the LPS2X library. The LPS22 is very similar to the LPS25 but not identical, so the libraries are able to share some but not all of the code. Ladyada had previously refactored the Adafruit_LPS2X Arduino library to add the LPS22HB, so my task was to do the same for the Adafruit_CircuitPython_LPS2X library. [This refactor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LPS2X/commit/824b0440ee89e662fd2581e888d0d4fd6cfbb586) is a good example of a fundamental technique of object oriented programming, [subclasses and superclasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance\_(object-oriented_programming)#Subclasses\_and\_superclasses). The base class LPS2X takes up the bulk of the library and includes all of the code that is common to both sensors. The LPS22 and LPS25 subclasses then inherit from LPS2X and then make small but meaningful changes to allow it to fit their particular requirements.

The end result is that rather than repeating the process of writing code that fulfills the common needs of both sensors, I am able to write it once and share it between both sensors. This idea is often called [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t\_repeat\_yourself) or DRY and in addition to reducing the amount of redundant code, it also centralizes the common code which makes it easier to fix or add features that are common across different uses.

**Dan**

I'm continuing the re-implementation of CircuitPython \_bleio on host computers using the [bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) Python library. I'm using the Heart [Rate Monitor library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_Heart_Rate) as a test, and had to implement most of \_bleio to get even that simple library to work. I had to make some changes to the base [adafruit_ble library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE) to accommodate Python on the host machines, and I'm testing now.

**Jeff**

On the STM32F405 Feather, I have finished SDIO read and write code.  The performance is better than SPI, especially when you are moving more data around.  However, even just writing a log file in text, you can log over 1000 lines per second!  This is on a "fresh", class-4 4GB SD card, I'm not sure how performance changes as the card fills up.

This code is in an open pull request on GitHub, so if you are comfortable building CircuitPython from source you can give it a try today.

[![Jeff](../assets/20200609/jeff1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Next we want to bring SDIO code to the SAMD51.  However, all the existing adafruit boards use SPI.  Hopefully this "breakout", made from a micro SD adapter, will let me get the prototype code working:

[![Jeff](../assets/20200609/jeff2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

While taking a break from SD cards, I returned to a problem that had been reported but never addressed: When using AudioMixer, if voice[0] was not playing anything, the sounds from other voices was distorted.  I also discovered a reason for pops when starting/stopping playback on voice[0], with the same root cause.  These bugfixes are now in the latest master branch, and should be a part of 5.4.0 when it is released.

**Kattni**

This week I started the AHTx0 CircuitPython driver, but due to timing, finalising that was handed back to Ladyada. Instead, I completed the AHT20 product guide. The AHT20 is a low-cost temperature and humidity sensor on a breakout that includes STEMMA QT connectors so you can get started quickly without soldering. The guide covers pinouts, Arduino usage, CircuitPython usage and downloads related to board including schematic, Fritzing object, EagleCAD files, and data sheet. The board will be in the Adafruit shop soon, so if you're looking for a lower cost alternative for sending temperature and humidity, keep an eye out for that.

**Lucian**

This week had a couple of major bugs come up across the STM32 and i.MX, so I've been hopping between the two projects as issues emerge. My big project of the last few days has been revisiting the clock management of the STM32s, to both fix some low-power related Real Time Clock (RTC) setup issues that were causing crashes across several dev boards, but also to make it a bit more comprehensive and maintainable. It's been useful to learn about some of the features I've been taking for granted, and should allow new STM32 boards to enable more low power customization. 

I've also wrapped up my i.MX testing on the 1010, just in time to get some new reset issues on the 1060 series. I've been doing my best to get quick hotfixes in, and then following up with more comprehensive reworks later, so boards don't stay out of commission too long. I'm hoping my i.MX feather will arrive to complement my Teensy 4.0 soon, so I can have a wider range of easily debugged chips to test with. 

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20200609/melissa1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I was working on catching up with some of my smaller projects. One of the projects that I really enjoyed working on was writing up a couple of demos for an eInk bonnet. Since I didn't actually have the eInk bonnet, I assembled one using the Adafruit Perma-Proto HAT for the Raspberry Pi along with an eInk breakout and a few passive components that I had on hand.

One of the demos I worked on went out and fetched weather data and displayed it on the eInk. This was a little challenging in that using too small of fonts would result in reduced readability, so I needed to experiment with font size, boldness, and the overall layout and it came together nicely. The code is based on the PyPortal weather code, but uses the meteocons font, which was inspired by Dan Cogliano, to display the weather image. So there's actually no graphics involved in the traditional sense.

[![Melissa](../assets/20200609/melissa2.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Another project that I worked on was updating the WebSerial 3D viewer that I had built a few months back in order to display calibration information for the BNO055. The cool part of this is that the calibration window will automatically appear only when calibration information is sent, so using the page with a board such as the CLUE will still look like it did before. I wrote up a guide page for that as well, which can be found inside the [Adafruit BNO055 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor/webserial-visualizer).

**Scott**

This past week I finished up busio.I2C on the ESP32-S2. Thanks to MarkOlsson for pointing out a problem with ACK/NAK that got a sensor working. Once that was done, I added pin validation and pull up checking. Next up is UART and SPI. I'll also be doing a new beta release shortly.
