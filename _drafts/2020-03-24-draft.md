Pigweed is a collection of embedded-targeted libraries. They are open source for 32-bit microcontroller development released by Google. They address the classic challenge in the embedded space of reducing the time from running git clone to having a binary executing on a device, setting up an entire suite of tools needed for non-trivial production embedded projects. - [Google Blog](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/03/pigweed-collection-of-embedded-libraries.html) and [Source](http://pigweed.googlesource.com/)

Allowing studenta access to the serial REPL in CircuitPython on Chromebooks can be difficult on centrally locked down devices. Here is a web based IDE (crafted in HTML and JavaScript) that lets you see the REPL. Luckily due to WebUSB, this is actually possible as long as you are using a modern version of Chrome. - [Forum Post](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=163583) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Mr-Coxall/CircuitPython-IDE)

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/DIR-LOCATION/DATE-blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep an eye out here for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

This week I'm working on the breakout for the DS1841 Temperature-Controlled, Non-Volatile I2C Logarithmic Resistor from Maxim. This chip is super cool. It's intended purpose is to provide temperature compensated bias control for avalanche photodiodes (APDs) used in optical transceivers. They're new to me, but apparently APDs are commonly used because they have a high sensitivity and wide bandwidth at the cost of being sensitive to temperature fluctuations. This chip can help with that! You can check out [this app note](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/1/1831.html) if you want to learn a bit more about APDs.

[![Bryan](../assets/03242020/03242020bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

While most of us don't have a private fiber optic network with fussy APDs, the DS1841 has enough bells and whistles that I'm sure you'll be able to find a use for it in a project. It's basically an I2C controller potentiometer with a logarithmic curve, so you can use it in place of a mechanical log potentiometer to allow you to control it programmatically. Furthermore, the temperature compensation uses a LUT (look up table) to allow the user to adjust how the resistance varies according to temperature. You can however turn off the temperature based adjustment and use the LUT directly to give you the same control over the behavior of the resistance!

[![Bryan](../assets/03242020/03242020bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm looking forward to seeing what you all can do with this chip. While testing I've got it hooked up in a simple voltage divider. You could do something similar to control all sorts of things. LEDs, DC/DC converters, Op-Amps, the possibilities are endless!

**Dan**

I've been able to connect via BLE with some inexpensive readily available cooking thermometers. The ones I have all identify as "iBBQ". Someone on the great world wide web [wrote up its BLE specs](https://gist.github.com/uucidl/b9c60b6d36d8080d085a8e3310621d64), and I was able to create a CircuitPython library quickly.

I'd never used [adafruit.io](https://adafruit.io/) for anything before, so I cooked up a quick demo which gets temperatures and battery status via BLE and sends it on it via an [AirLift FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4264). I used the latest [CircuitPython MQTT library](https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-in-circuitpython/circuitpython-wifi-usage) which Brent R. released just yesterday. It worked great!

[![Dan](../assets/03242020/03242020dan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

[![Dan](../assets/03242020/03242020dan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I'm also working on a CircuitPython library that implements all the services we provide for the [Bluefruit Playground app](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app). We have [Arduino code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/blob/master/libraries/Bluefruit52Lib/examples/Peripheral/bluefruit_playground/bluefruit_playground.ino) for this, but haven't implemented it in CircuitPython yet. When I finish you'll be able to both send and receive data for all the on-board sensors, buttons, and peripherals on the Circuit Playground Bluefruit and the CLUE boards.

Finally, I'm still debugging spurious writes to the SAMD51 internal flash -- no breakthroughs yet, but I have some clues.

**Jeff**

Together with PaintYourDragon, we are working on a new library for LED panels.  Dragon is doing the heavy lifting, creating the low level code (and Arduino bindings); I'm adapting it to fit CircuitPython.  In the future, CircuitPython will be able to drive displays like these, probably using the displayio module that is used for LCD and e-ink displays:

[![Jeff](../assets/03242020/03242020jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

We are also working towards releasing version 5.1.0 of the core CircuitPython code, and I am doing more of the release-related tasks this time around.  Two exciting additions are ulab, which I've talked about in other updates; and support for "f-strings", a more modern and concise way to build strings than "%" or ".format()".  Both of these features are expected to be available on higher powered CircuitPython devices with SAMD51, nRF, and STM microcontrollers.

**Kattni**

This week, we finished updating all the CircuitPython libraries to use the latest Pylint and implemented the Black Python formatter. This was a huge project - thanks to Dylan for all his hard work. We updated the [Pylint guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/improve-your-code-with-pylint) to include Black and reference the latest version of Pylint. If you're going to contribute code to a CircuitPython library, check out this guide for how to ensure your code is up to standards.

I'm currently working on the Bonsai Buckaroo guide. This guide will have all the details on the board, and examples for both the CLUE and the micro:bit. Keep an eye out for that coming soon!

**Lucian**

[![Lucian](../assets/0mdd2020/lucian.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)



**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/03242020/03242020melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I have been working on a guide for adding a new Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect, which is the first part of adding a new Board to Blinka. You can check out the guide, which is available at [https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka).

After finishing that guide, I started on the guide for the next part, which is adding a new board to Blinka. This is probably the most difficult guide I've written due to the complexities of adding a new board and trying to explain it in an easy to understand way. Be sure to look out for the new Blinka guide coming soon.

In addition to the new guide, I will be applying a new look to the Web Bluetooth Dashboard that I had worked on a couple of weeks ago that one of our designers came up with. Be sure to look out for that as well.

**Scott**

This week I've continued adding low power support to the different chip families. SAMD51 and SAMD21 now work. The Spresense port is building but untested.

This week I'm working on STM32 support and hopefully starting iMX RT support after that. The trickiest bit is providing a higher resolution clock for PulseIn to use.

Once they are all preliminarily tested, I'll put out a call for folks to test it. So, keep an eye out.

Lastly, on Saturday I streamed myself working on TinyLogicFriend, which is logic analyzer firmware built on top of TinyUSB. It will hook into Sigrok on the desktop side. There is also a [recording of the stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qetJHmfNA_g).

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
